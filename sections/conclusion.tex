\section*{\bf Conclusion}
We performed here a comprehensive study of the statistical considerations of the classic muon lifetime measurement. We were able to extrapolate a very precise lifetime $\tau_{avg} = 2.216679 \pm 0.013 \times 10^{-6}$ s, which is within $10^{-8}$s of the expected lifetime \mbox{$\tau_\mu = 2.196981(22) \times 10^{-6}$} s \cite{ber}\cite{pat}.
